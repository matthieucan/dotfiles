! Right Alt -> Left Control

!Run this once, sometimes xmodmap forgets about it:
!keycode 108 = Alt_R

!And run this for every session:
remove Mod1 = Alt_R
keysym Alt_R = Control_L
add control = Control_L

!Note: works with session "Gnome on Xorg" while logging in in GDM

! Mod_switch

! Alternatively, edit /usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/pc to add near the bottom:
! key <Alt_R> {       [  Ctrl_L               ]       };
